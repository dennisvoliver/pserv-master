    The server currently supports the basic functionalities of a traditional web server:
    1. It can fetch files like .html, .js and .css and returns the appropriate content type headers based
    on the file suffix.
    2. It truncates paths that use two adjacent periods (../../../) to prevent unauthorized directory
    traversal.
    3. It implements persistent connections according to the HTTP/1.1 protocol.
    4. It has multiple client support, i.e. multiple clients can connect to it simultaneously.
    5. It uses threads instead of forking new processes to avoid the overhead of process context switching.
    
    TODO:
    1. Add support for HTML5 Fallback
    2. Implement HTTP range requests to enable streaming
    3. Add support for single user authentication
